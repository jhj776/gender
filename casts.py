# casts.py
#	version 0.1.2
#		now handles the minority of cast lists organized as html tables rather than html lists.
#		minor additions to genderwords.json
#		excludes a few more "nonstandard" lines that are not actor/ character pairs.
#			problem: rising % of "unknown" gender over time (from 2.5% -> 5.5% 1930-2018, US)
#			problem: rising % of mismatched actor and character genders over time (1.5% -> 2.5% US)
#			problem: no case distinctions e.g., chick-> female; Chick-> male.
#			problem: multiple characters for same actor; divided sometimes by /, sometimes indented lists
#	1. reads a series of text files of cast lists from wikipedia movie .html files and parses each line into 3 segments
#		- actor
#		- character
#		- other description
#	2. assigns genders to actor and character names 
#		(female, mostly_female, andy, mostly_male, male, unknown)
#		counts how often actor and character genders match, or partly match
#	eventually will:
#		3. count how often the character's name (first, last, both) appear in plot summary
#			eventually even attribute "he","she","her", etc to that character
#		4. associate each character with one or more "occupations"
#			codes some ~30,000 "jobtitles" into 2010 3-digit U.S. Census codes 
#
#	arg= prefix is a filename prefix to output (& input) files
#		e.g. python3 casts.py NYT
#
#	input:
#		prefix+files.txt (e.g., USfiles.txt)= a file of filenames of text files (cast lists) to be read and coded for gender.
#		gendernames.json	revisions of gender_guesser, "name": "gender",
#
#	to compile casts.py:
#		uses python standard packages: sys json
#		uses python packages that must be downloaded and installed: gender_guesser BeautifulSoup
#			e.g. pip install BeautifulSoup4
#			e.g. pip install gender-guesser  (see:  https://pypi.org/project/gender-guesser/)
